      - role: Senior Data Scientist	
        time: January 2022 - Present
        company: HelloFresh, Berlin
        details: | 
            Built a Bayesian Inference Engine which calculates effect sizes and associated 
            test statistics for 1000s of simultaneous experiments. Reduced the compute time 
            from 24 hours to 40 minutes when compared to the previous solution. 
            The new engine supports 18+ decision metrics, compared to the previous 2. 
            Led cultural change within the company: HF adopted a risk based approach to experimentation.

      - role: Data Scientist	
        time: January 2022 - Present
        company: HelloFresh. Berlin
        details: |
            Built a forecasting system for weekly meal boxes shipped by HelloFresh. Produces a 5% 
            error in all HelloFresh markets. The simple linear model and Sarimax are still in production.
            Developed time series bootstrap methods to produce empirical prediction intervals for all HelloFresh forecasts.
            Re-wrote an internal operations tool to calculate recipe splits from headline box counts. 
            The tool was originally written in excel and was then imported to Python, reducing the lead time from 
            1 hour to 30 seconds whilst making the recipe ordering process more robust
            Developed and built a channel and discount targeting model to identify high value customers for 
            HelloFresh reactivation campaigns. Identified the top 20% of the customer base which brought 80% of the conversions and revenue.
            Worked with internal HelloFresh stakeholders to run A/B tests of marketing models against the 
            business usual approach. In 1 test the DS model had an 8% uplift which resulted in €7k extra profit. 
            The model replaced the business as usual approach and remains in production.
      
      - role: Research Associate
        time: October 2016 - October 2017
        company: United Kingdom Hydrographic Office/University of Bristol
        details: |
            Designed a text processing engine prototype which used Apache UIMA and used the extraction framework ‘Baleen’ to process 100s of PDF for a custom named entity recognition problem. automated and streamlined an upgrade of 100 NtMs per week and saved £1k when NtM was updated
            Developed an automated text analysis system which extracted location data and related information from multiple sources
            Built a web portal and used BottlePy and Heroku and ran an internal tagging competition which annotated a text corpus provided by UKHO to identify Notices to Mariners from unstructured text.
            Summarised and investigated NLP methods from the uses of NLTK, Gensim, Keras, Tensorflow, and Transformers.
