    - role: Senior Data Scientist
      time: January 2022 - Present
      company: HelloFresh, Berlin
      description: |
        Built a Bayesian Inference Engine which calculates effect sizes and associated 
        test statistics for 1000s of simultaneous experiments. Reduced the compute time 
        from 24 hours to 40 minutes compared to the previous solution. The new engine 
        supports 18+ decision metrics, compared to the previous 2. Led cultural change 
        within the company: HF adopted a risk-based approach to experimentation.
    - role: Data Scientist
      time: January 2022 - Present
      company: HelloFresh, Berlin
      description: |
        Built a forecasting system for weekly meal boxes shipped by HelloFresh. Produces 
        a 5% error in all HelloFresh markets. The simple linear model and Sarimax are 
        still in production. Developed time series bootstrap methods to produce empirical 
        prediction intervals for all HelloFresh forecasts. Re-wrote an internal operations 
        tool to calculate recipe splits from headline box counts. Reduced the lead time 
        from 1 hour to 30 seconds, making the recipe ordering process more robust. 
        Developed and built a channel and discount targeting model to identify high-value 
        customers for HelloFresh reactivation campaigns. Worked with internal stakeholders 
        to run A/B tests of marketing models against the business usual approach. 
        In one test, the DS model had an 8% uplift, resulting in €7k extra profit.
    - role: Research Associate
      time: October 2016 - October 2017
      company: United Kingdom Hydrographic Office/University of Bristol
      description: |
        Designed a text processing engine prototype using Apache UIMA and ‘Baleen’ for 
        custom named entity recognition. Automated text analysis system extracted location 
        data from multiple sources. Built a web portal using BottlePy and Heroku for an 
        internal tagging competition. Summarised and investigated NLP methods including 
        NLTK, Gensim, Keras, Tensorflow, and Transformers.
